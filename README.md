CRONO is a Cluster Management System aimed at small and mid-size GNU/Linux cluster installations owned by non-specialized users. CRONO implements only the basic management services needed to share a cluster among several users, being therefore easy to install, maintain and use, while still being highly configurable. Some features of CRONO are: support to manage one or more than one cluster, space and time shared allocation, batch jobs and interactive modes, FIFO+backfilling scheduling algorithm, pre and post processing scripts and possibility to define access rights for users and user groups, advance reservations.

CRONO also supports qualitative allocation and other features to manage heterogeneous clusters.
